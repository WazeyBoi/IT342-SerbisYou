About Me:
Hi! I am Michael Andre B. Ligan, a third-year student pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. I hail from Poblacion, Dalaguete, Cebu, though I am currently residing in Guadalupe, Cebu City.

I have a wide range of interests that keep me engaged during my free time. I enjoy playing online games, particularly those that challenge my strategy and teamwork skills. When I’m not gaming, you’ll find me binge-watching Netflix movies and series, where I love immersing myself in different genres and storytelling styles.

Another hobby of mine is cooking, and I love experimenting with new recipes or creating fusion dishes.

In terms of my passion and career aspirations, I am deeply interested in video editing, front-end web design, and mobile app development. I enjoy exploring creative solutions and always aim to improve my skills in these areas. Building intuitive and visually appealing designs, along with crafting seamless user experiences, is something I truly love to do.

I'm always excited to learn new technologies and stay updated with the latest trends in IT, as they fuel my passion for both personal projects and my future career.
